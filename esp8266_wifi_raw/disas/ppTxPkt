By experimentation and debugging, I found out some info
on the structure of the ppTxPkt arguments.

From what I can understand, ppTxPkt takes one pointer to a struct of some kind.
This struct contains various pointers. The first pointer points to the pbuf struct
passed to the ieee80211_output_pbuf function. The 5th 4-byte group is a pointer to
the actual IEEE-802.11 payload data.
