One idea for how the commands format could look like:

+-------+-------+-------+-------+------ ... -------+
|               |               |                  |
|    LENGTH     |      TYPE     |  REST OF COMMAND |
|               |               |                  |
+-------+-------+-------+-------+------ ... -------+


LENGTH (2 bytes):
length of the whole packet, including the LENGTH and TYPE fields.
The minimum value of the LENGTH field is 4.

TYPE (2 bytes):
type of command, may be extensible by reserving 0xffff for additional bytes in the REST OF COMMAND.

REST OF COMMAND (variable length):
the rest of the command, containing type-specific content, and/or type extensions if TYPE = 0xffff.
The length of this field is equal to (LENGTH - 4) bytes.


IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PARSER:
The server parser will read the LENGTH and TYPE fields, and forward the packet to the queue
of the appropriate device driver or general commands. Fragments will be reassembled until
the LENGTH value is reached, or a timeout occurs, in which case the packet will be discarded
and possibly a failure notice may be sent. One must be careful not to combine fragments coming
from different connections. Might need to compare the IP address and port.
One way to implement the timeout would be for the server to store a NOW() timestamp in the
first received chunk, and compare the current NOW() value with this initial timestamp. Or maybe
using an ETSTimer. Not sure how many of these can run concurrently.

When a packet has been fully reassembled (generally, that shouldn't be too long
since most commands ought to be quite short, fitting in one tcp recv callback)
it can be processed by the driver.

Though there are issues, such as whether the order in which packets are processed should matter.
If the user sent the commands A, B and C in that order, he might expect the driver to process
them in that order as well. But what if the driver finished reassembling B before A? Should it
go on to execute B? Also, how does one decide between commands given by two different users?
Depending on the order of execution, the results could be quite different...
